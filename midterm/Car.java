Simple Modeling (see problem statement here)

Implement a class Car with the following properties. A car has a certain fuel efficiency
(measured in miles/gallon or liters/kmâ€”pick one) and a certain amount of
fuel in the gas tank. The efficiency is specified in the constructor, and the initial fuel
level is 0. Supply a method drive that simulates driving the car for a certain distance,
reducing the amount of gasoline in the fuel tank. Also supply methods getGasInTank,
returning the current amount of gasoline in the fuel tank, and addGas, to add gasoline
to the fuel tank. Sample usage:
Car myHybrid = new Car(50); // 50 miles per gallon
myHybrid.addGas(20); // Tank 20 gallons
Practice Exercises 123
myHybrid.drive(100); // Drive 100 miles
double gasLeft = myHybrid.getGasInTank(); // Get gas remaining in tank
You may assume that the drive method is never called with a distance that consumes
more than the available
gas. Supply a CarTester class that tests all methods.
