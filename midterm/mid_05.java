/*The Bank Account Problem (see problem statement here)

•• R1.13 Write an algorithm to settle the following question: A bank account starts out with
$10,000. Interest is compounded monthly at 6 percent per year (0.5 percent per
month). Every month, $500 is withdrawn to meet college expenses. After how many
years is the account depleted?
••• R1.14 Consider the question in Exercise R1.13. Suppose the numbers ($10,000, 6 percent,
$500) were user selectable. Are there values for which the algorithm you developed
would not terminate? If so, change the algorithm to make sure it always terminates.

10000 6 500 says: Account lasts 1 years 9 months
